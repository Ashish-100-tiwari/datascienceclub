## Introduction

Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. Python, with its simplicity and wide array of libraries, is the most popular programming language for data science.

In this post, we will explore the basics of data science using Python. We will cover some of the essential libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**, and demonstrate how to use them through code snippets.

By the end of this post, you'll be familiar with:

- Loading and manipulating data using Pandas
- Performing basic data analysis with NumPy
- Visualizing data with Matplotlib
- Building a simple machine learning model with Scikit-learn

Let's dive in!

## 1. Loading and Manipulating Data with Pandas

Pandas is one of the most powerful and flexible libraries for data manipulation in Python. It provides data structures like **DataFrame** and **Series** to work with structured data efficiently.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Loading data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Filtering rows where a column 'age' is greater than 30
filtered_data = data[data['age'] > 30]

# Display filtered data
print(filtered_data)
```

Now testing New Thing 
```python
import pandas as pd

# Loading data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Filtering rows where a column 'age' is greater than 30
filtered_data = data[data['age'] > 30]

# Display filtered data
print(filtered_data)
